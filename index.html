        <p>I'm currently building robots at XYZ Robotics.</p>
        <p>
          Previously, I worked as an AI research engineer at YITU Tech. I
          completed an M.Eng. (B.Eng. Integrated) degree in Electrical &
          Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London, where my advisor
          was Yiannis Demiris.

          My interests include robotics, machine learning, autonomous systems,
          and computational neuroscience. I also enjoy skydiving, skiing, and
          surfing.
